# CommunityLink 

# Note
As the project relies on supabase for db queries and I am using the free tier, supabase may go down leaving the site not responsive.

## About The App
CommunityLink is a website built to simplify community management and interactions. This project was undertaken as a challenge to explore the world of Typescript and build a powerful tool for community administrators and members. With React and Typescript as the frontend stack and Node.js along with Express.js as the backend, CommunityLink aims to streamline community-related tasks and enhance user experiences.

## Technologies
I used `reactjs`, `typescript`, `tailwdindcss`, `nodejs`, `expressjs`, `supabase`


## Status
The project is still in progress, I intend to add testing into the project. The plan is to also dockersize the project in the future as and when I get time.
